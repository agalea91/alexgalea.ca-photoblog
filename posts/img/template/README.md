# Post Directory

The post filestore is a local object that can be moved between development machines using s3.

## Generating posts for the web app

This directory is distinct from the public `img` folder for the web app.

Those are generated by running `update_public_posts.py`. Note that:
- The existing `public/img` dir is deleted.
- Posts starting with an underscore are ignored.
- Images are downsized and watermarked according to global script variables.
